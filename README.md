For Project 2 we were tasked with writing he code that was left out in the main loop of the pirate treasure hunt application that we were given. The specific code that I created allowed for the pirate agent to decide the strategy for action that it was going to use in order to get to the treasure the quickest and with the most possible rewards. This code specifically utilized exploartion and exploitation in order to teach the pirate the best possible route within the maze.

As a computer scientist, I approach problems with a very scientific way. I have my hypothesis and I then take steps in order to solve my hypothesis or prove it incorrect. Within the field of CS, this tends to typically be solved with the utilization of an algorthimic equation. 

When it comes to users whenever AI is involvede, I always find it is best to be as honest as you possibly can. The more you convey to the client or the user, the better you are in the long run. Its all about giving the user the option to opt out of using an app as long as they know everything involved you are ethically in the clear. So when it comes to AI, the more you let the user know the better your app/game/database will be.
